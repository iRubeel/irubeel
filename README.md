**AI Software Engineer** with **2+ years of experience** building intelligent systems, data-driven applications, and scalable backend infrastructure. Specializing in **AI/ML integration**, **LLMs**, **predictive modeling**, and **cloud-native architectures** across Python, C#/.NET, Azure, and modern data platforms.

Co-Founder of **[NoizeOff.com](https://noizeoff.com)**, a platform for research intelligence and voice AI, featuring **sigmaXiv** for AI-powered paper summaries and **FlowTalk** for natural voice conversations and intelligent calendar generation that creates personalized study schedules based.

### 🚀 Core Expertise

**AI & Machine Learning**: Building production-ready AI agents, LLM integration, and intelligent automation systems. Expertise in predictive modeling (CO2 emissions forecasting, diabetes risk prediction), NLP sentiment analysis, and image classification (extreme weather events). Proficient in **Python**, **PySpark**, **scikit-learn**, and **XGBoost**. Developed voice AI tools like **FlowTalk** within the NoizeOff ecosystem to support student anxiety management and study planning.

**Full-Stack Development**: Crafting modern web applications with **React** and **Next.js**, developing desktop applications with **Java Swing** (InvestmentPortfolio), and building interactive dashboards with **R Shiny**. Strong foundation in **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and responsive design.

**Data Engineering & Analytics**: Expert in data pipeline development, scaling **PostgreSQL** with **Rust** (PgDog), and deploying ML models in production. Skilled in extracting insights from complex datasets and building data-driven solutions.

**Systems & Tools**: Advanced Git workflows (branching, merging, conflict resolution), database management (PostgreSQL, Supabase), API development, and deploying scalable systems.

### 💡 What Sets Me Apart

Combining technical depth across multiple languages with a product-focused mindset. I don't just write code—I build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, from academic assistants to financial AI agents.

### 🌟 Featured Projects

- **[NoizeOff.com](https://noizeoff.com)**: My personal project—a research intelligence platform with AI tools like **sigmaXiv** for paper summaries and **FlowTalk** for voice-based conversations and intelligent calendar generation that creates personalized study schedules.
- **[FinSureAI](https://finsureai.vercel.app)**: Fine-tune LLM models with custom policy data in minutes for on-prem deployment. Upload datasets, launch Modal GPU jobs, monitor training progress, and chat with your customized model directly in the dashboard.
- **CO₂ Prediction Model for PEI & NB Potato Farms**: Predictive model for CO₂ concentrations using environmental sensor data, benchmarking Linear Regression and XGBoost with five-fold cross-validation to forecast emissions across Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick potato fields.
- **Diabetes Risk Prediction**: Real-time risk assessment app built with R Shiny, using health indicators (BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure) to predict diabetes risk with an interactive user interface.
- **Extreme-Weather-Event-Image-Classifier**: ML-based image classification for weather events.
